# Minecraft Plugin Setup
Building the Plugin

To build the Minecraft plugin, make sure to include the following libraries and files in your build artifacts:

com.zaxxer:HikariCP:5.1.O

org.mariadb.jdbc:mariadb-java-client:3.4.0

paper-plugin.yml

config.yml

These files must be present in the final JAR so that Paper can load your plugin and its configuration correctly.
